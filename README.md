# Adaptive-Mesh-Refinment
Quad Tree Data Structure, coded in PYTHON and MATLAB. Used to condense grid point system for simulating diffusion (using finite difference scheme). This data structure starts with a completely uniform grid system and works from the bottom-up to create a refined adpative mesh grid system. Open up Cirlce_AMR.jpg to see an image of the AMR grid system
